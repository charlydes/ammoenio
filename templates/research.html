            <br>
            <h4> CoinMarketCap API [2] </h4>

            <h4> TestRPC [3] </h4>
            <p>TestRPC is a tool that creates a simulated version of the Ethereum Blockchain. TestRPC is a public tool and library, but we are making use of a customised version of this RPC client. We have increased the gas limit from 4 million gas to around
                10 million gas and the number of available accounts (wallets) from 10 to 201 (one controller account and 200 that can be used by the users). We have also changed the default ETH balance from 100 ETH (approximately 350 GBP) to approximately
                10 000 000 000 ETH (approximately 35 billion GBP) to allow for comprehensive testing and debugging.
            </p>
            <p>In the actual project, TestRPC would be replaced by the real Ethereum Blockchain and the use of ETH would be replaced by GBP. ETH would only be used for processing and completing transactions which will take from 5 up to 20 minutes, meaning
                changes in conversion rate should have almost no effect on the user (we expect no steep changes in a 5-20 minutes time period). Both the user and the company would have GBP balances.

            <h4> Nodemon [4] </h4>
            <p>We used nodemon for running the server application. This enables easy restarting of the server in case of crashing due to an error.

            <h4> AngularJS [7] </h4>
            <p>Angular is a JavaScript framework that allows for $scope variables and, therefore, a direct interaction with the DOM. We chose this framework because of its fast and simple connection with the Firebase database through the AngularFire library.

            <h4> Zeppelin Solidity / OpenZeppelin [8] </h4>
            <p>We based our smart contracts on the Zeppelin Solidity library to ensure that they were safe. Zeppelin Solidity is a library for writing secure Smart Contracts on Ethereum. The library allows you to build distributed applications, protocols
                and organizations using common contract security patterns (See Onward with Ethereum Smart Contract Security) in the Solidity language.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Bootstrap [9] </h4>
            <p>We used bootstrap on the front end to facilitate some design processes. This library provides css classes for different elements (eg. buttons, forms etc.).
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Angular Fire [10] </h4>
            <p>Angular Fire is a powerful Angular JS library that make querying the Firebase database easier. With simple methods such as $firebaseObject() and $firebaseArray(), we could easily store database information in $scope variables, ready to use
                in the AngularJS logic and in the HTML front-end.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> ExpressJS [11] </h4>
            <p>ExpressJS was used for routing and HTTP requests handling. ExpressJS is essential for communicating with the AngularJS web app.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Solidity Compiler (SolC) [12] </h4>
            <p>SolC was used for compiling the contract after parsing them
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Contracts Creator (eth-new-contract) [13] </h4>
            <p>Eth-new-contract is used for deploying contracts to the Blockchain/RPC client via the Web3JS API.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Locks [14] </h4>
            <p>Locks are Asynchronous locks used for locking reading and writing of files.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Body-parser [15] </h4>
            <p>Body-parser is a parsing middleware used for JSON parsing of the date in the HTTP requests.

            <h2>Decisions <i class="fa fa-bullhorn" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
            <h4>Here you can read about how we decided what tools and programming languages to use at the forefront of our project.</h4>
            <hr style="padding-bottom: 8px">
            <h4> Ethereum </h4>
            <p> We chose to use the Ethereum blockchain as it specifically focused around smart contracts, and that was exactly what we needed to use for this project. Furthermore, it allowed us to create a local blockchain and there were many libraries that
                supported Ethereum in general.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Solidity </h4>
            <p> We used Solidity to write the smart contracts since it was the language that ethereum required. Furthermore, since it is similar to JavaScript which we knew before it was easier for us to understand how to read and write code.
            </p><br>
            <h4> Web3JS API (Web3 JavaScript Ðapp API) </h4>
            <p>The Web3JS API is the mainstream option for Ethereum development. After discussing with our client, discussing with our internal supervisor and with Mr. Hirch, as well as after doing our own research, we decided to go aong with Web3JS.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> TestRPC </h4>
            <p> We chose to use TestRPC as it seemed the most reliable client to run our local blockchain and tools on, and once again it worked together with Ethereum.
            </p><br>
            <h4> AngularJS </h4>
            <p> We chose the Angular JS framework because it makes a strong and reliable couple with the Firebase services, thanks to Angular Fire. This is a framework developed by Google that allows powerful communication between the two.</p><br>
            <h4> Firebase </h4>
            <p> We chose to use Firebase because it provides all the services we need into one unique console. The great advantage is that is brings everything together. We have compared this with using separate systems such as the AWS or Microsoft products but nothing came near to Firebase's simplicity and organisation. An example of this is that Firebase allows us to perform operations on users from the front end of the console. We can easily delete, add or reset's a user's password with a couple clicks. Furthermore, the basic Firebase package is free of cost.</p><br>
            <h4> Truffle </h4>
            <p> We used Truffle as it provided us with the ability to build a decentralized app and connect a front-end to the smart contracts. Even though we were not able to use this feature due to the nature of how web frameworks like AngularJS work, it
                was useful in the testing phase for checking if the smart-contracts alone worked, if they are secure and also to write automated tests for the system.
            </p><br>
            <h4> NodeJS &amp; ExpressJS </h4>
            <p>A NodeJS webserver was at no point in the first term meant to be used in our project. The plan was to use Truffle which is the mainstream development enviroment for Solidity. </p>
            <p> After the beggining of term 2, we encountered massive issues with integrading Truffle in our project (even though we succesfully used Truffle for the writting and testing of contracts). Looking for alternatives, the only reasonable option
                was the use of a NodeJS server that communicates with the front-end via HTTP requests managed by ExpresJS.
