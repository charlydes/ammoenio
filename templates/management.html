In the latter case the platform automatically recognizes whether the user has a business or investor account. If a user wishes to create an account they can choose between creating one of the aforementioned accounts. A business account only allows the creation of companies and investing in them, not displaying all the other companies in the platform. An investor account allows a user to view all the available companies, invest in them, and buy or sell shares.</span></p>

            <h2>System Manual </h2>
            <h4>Here you can read about how to deploy the project on to a server.</h4>
            <hr>

            <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Not much is needed to be able to run the app. All libraries are included in the projects. Certain tools are however necessary. To be able to run the app, you need to have the latest versions of NodeJS and NPM installed as well as Nodemon (can be installed via NPM). Git is not necessary for debugging and testing, though it is what we used to always pull the latest version from the repository. Tmux is not necessary, but we do recommend installing it as it is needed for running one of the scripts if needed. To install all these tools, we recommend running the InitialiseMachine.sh script (type “./InitialiseMachine.sh” in the terminal; make sure the permissions for executing are set appropriately) located in AmmoenioApp/Scripts/. This script will install all the aforementioned tools automatically. We have written all the bash scripts in order to make settings up the server and the debugging and testing of the application as easily as possible. </span></p>
            <br>
            <p class="c10"><span class="c1">To run the app, all that is needed is to run: RunAmmoenioOnPC.sh located in the same folder as the previous script. This will start the TestRPC client and then it will start the NodeJS server application after a delay of 8 seconds (needed to load the RPC client). Alternatively, RunAmmoenioOnServer.sh can be runned. This scripts is specifically designed to be run on servers that do not provide as user interface (or a graphical server in Ubuntu’s case). It can be used on the local computer nonetheless provided Tmux is installed. Alternatively, the two can be runned manually: TestRPC can be runned from StartTestRPC.sh or from AmmoenioApp/Ethereum Component/TestRPC/bin/testrpc (type“./testrpc”);the NodeJS server can be ran from AmmoenioApp/Back-End/Server.js with “sudo nodemon Server.js” (“sudo” is needed as the Server.js listens to port 80 which is reserved).</span></p>
            <br>
            <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Note: Certain particular system specifications might render some scripts unable to run. For example, nodemon was not running in sudo mode on a computer we tested. Some scripts will also not work on Mac due to gnome-terminal not being installed. That’s why we recommend Ubuntu 16.10 and the latest versions of NodeJS and NPM.         </span></p>
            <br>
            <p class="c20"><span class="c21">If the computer used also encountered an issue with NodeJS and NPM (usually due to not being installed right or not having the last version), a “listen EADDRINUSE ::: 80”error will be thrown.</span>
                <br><br>
                <div class="row"><img style="width: 100%;" src="../img/port80error.png"></div><br>
                <p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1"> You can choose to run the server on a non-reserved port, e.g.  port 8000. To do this, you need to edit the file Server.js and change the line:</span></p>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c13">const PORT_TO_RUN = &#39;80&#39;;</span></p>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1">to something like</span></p>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c13">const PORT_TO_RUN = &#39;8000&#39;;</span></p>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1">(keep in mind port 8545 needs to be used by TestRPC).</span></p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1">TestRPC is using other 3rd party libraries that are specifically compiled for Ubuntu 16.04 or later, so they will not work on Macs. A second RPC client called EtherSim is provided that can be ran on Macs as well, but this does not seem to be so reliable as TestRPC and is largely outdated.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Also make note that when restarting the RPC client, all data stored in the local blockchain is deleted and the accounts are reset. That means that all the previous user accounts and companies are unusable. This will not be a real problem once the project is released as that one will use the real Ethereum Blockchain.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Server.js also has two modes of running. Running it with “nodemon Server.js” will launch make the server application run on normal mode: it will deploy a new controller and it will inform that it should start with a fresh user list. Alternatively, it can be runned on reload mode via “nodemon Server.js reload” (this is the default way in which the server application runs if making use of the provided scripts. The reload mode/function is useful if the server application has crashed and we do not want to loose all the previous data; this will look for the backup file stored in Backups and it will reload the user list and the controller contract. Please make note that this only works if the RPC client was not restarted. If the client is restarted, all the previous data is lost. Created user accounts and companies will still remain on the server though. When running RunAmmoenioOnPC.sh or RunAmmoenioOnServer.sh, they will delete the backup file and then start the server application on reload mode so that if the server application crashes, it can be easily restarted and reload the contracts and user list. Nodemon is specifically useful as it can easily restart the server application.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Please also note that only one RPC client can be running and only one instance of it. This is because the RPC client is a server application as well listening on port 8545 so it will reserve the port for itself and it will not allow other applications to run on it.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c1">After everything is up and running in the terminals, visit localhost:PORT_NUMBER (eg. localhost:80) to access the website.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c10"><span class="c21">An alternative way to test the platform is to visit our website </span><span class="c21 c22"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ammoenio.trade&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1493008389596000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHo2Nlfb7F5AzImtQBlwRCiVqbRsQ">www.ammoenio.trade</a></span>

            <p> The latest meeting with our client was on the 12/04/2017 when we demonstrated our project and we got the final hints from him before the submission on the 14/04/2017. All later changes to Ammoenio, were presented to our client via e-mail.</p>
            <br>
            <p> An additional meeting with our client in which we will present our ATOS video, our project, a 20 minutes PowerPoint presentation and a 5-10 minutes Q&A (according to ATOS standards for the contest) will be held on the 03/05/2017 at the ATOS
                Headquarters in London. These meeting was supposed to take place on the 26/04/2017, but was delayed due to conflict with our presentation from UCL and due to exams on the 27/04/2017 and 28/04/2017. This final meeting with the client will
                be a preparation for the final presentation for the ATOS IT Challenge 2017 contest that will be held on the 11/05/2017 at the ATOS Headquarters in London. There we will have to present our project before a jury and we aim to get one if
                the top 3 places. </p>
