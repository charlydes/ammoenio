            <hr>
            <p>Ammoenio allows individuals to buy shares either in start-ups or in already running companies. Once the individual has acquired some shares, he/she will make an income each time dividends are issued. Dividends will grant each individual an
                income from the profit of the company proportional to the number of shares they own.<br><br> Through the share-trading feature, the individual buys a share when its value is down while anticipating an increase in value at a later date.
                Selling the share at a higher value will generate income for the individual, while when owning that share, the individual also gets income from any dividends issued by the company. Ammoenio provides users with tools that enable them to
                see how the value of the shares is changing over time, helping them figure out when is the best time to buy a share and when to sell it.<br><br> Owning equity funds will also enable the individual to take part in company decisions by having
                voting rights, a feature that is essential in disrupting conventional business models. Voting in company decisions (including those of issuing dividends) can be done directly through the Ammoenio platform.

            <hr>
            <p>The business model for Ammoenio is meant to be one that is quite simple and straight-forward, but also efficient and attractive for all three parties: Ammoenio developers, businesses and investors. The monetisation is done through two main
                ways. First, there is a small fixed charge for every transaction when trading shares between individuals, but there is no charge for buying shares directly from the company issuing them. Secondly, there is a charge for getting dividends
                which is a small percentage of the individual’s income from dividends.

            <h4>Here you can find out about how we improved our design</h4>
            <hr>
            <p> We held discussions with a number of aproximatly 10-15 of our colleagues (as well as with our client) both in the early stages and in late stages of the project in order to get a better idea of how to improve our design (including the functional
                part, but especially the user interface). This was very useful as we came back a large number of times over the design and improved things.
            </p>
            <p> The largest number of improvements after holding these talks with our colleagues were on the UX side of the project (chaing the design of certain pages), but some of them were on the functional part as well (it helped us finalise our MoSCoW
                type requirements list). </p>
