            <h2>Requirements Gathering</h2>
            <h4>Here you can find out about how we gathered the requirements</h4>
            <hr>
            <p> First stage was researching the Blockchain technology and its possible uses. This took us about 2-3 weeks and it allowed us to get a much better understanding of what Blockchain is, how the technology works and where it can be applied, but
                also which are the current problems on the market relating to blockchain.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Next we started brainstorming and comming up with a diverse range of ideas over a period of 3 weeks which we presented to our client. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Finally, both us and our client decided on an idea: Ammoenio. This was done after resaerching the market, looking at problems, looking at possible competitors (such as Seedrs and CrowdCube).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> We have then continued to update our requirements depending on the seconds stage of research we have done and after talks with our client and with our TA.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> We have also held discussions with a number of aproximatly 10-15 of our colleagues both in the early stages and in late stages of the project in order to get a better idea of how our design should look like. This was very useful as we came
                back a large number of times over the design and improved things.
            </p>

            <h2>User cases</h2>
            <h4>Here you can read about how each type of user can use our platform</h4>
            <hr>

            <p>Ammoenio has two primary use cases. It targets both individuals who want to get into the share-trading business and start-ups or small businesses that wish to fund their projects by selling part of their business’s shares to individuals willing
                to invest into it.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3> Investors </h3>
            <br>

            <p>
                Users who want to invest can sign up with an investor account. From there, the user can browse the website to see which companies are available on the platform, either from the dashboard or by searching for a specific company. Clicking on a company, the
                user can see information about it including number of shares available for sale, legal documents, what kind of business it is and more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A user can choose to buy shares for a specific company by specifying the amount of money (in British Pounds) they want to spend. The platform then calculates how many shares the user can buy with that amount of money, also showing how much the gas transaction,
                pounds (GBP) to Ether (ETH) conversion and Ammoenio commission will cost. If the user confirms, the purchase is performed and the blockchain is updated with new values, providing the user with the purchased shares.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                An investor then has the ability to make their shares public by putting them on the market for sale. By going to the “My Investments” section and choosing a company the user has invested in, they have an option to specify the number of shares they want
                to sell. This will appear under the company’s profile when another user previews it, providing the option to buy shares both directly from the company and from other users.
            </p>
            <br>





            <h3>Business Owners</h3>
            <br>

            <p>
                Users who wish to start their own business and fund it using our platform can sign up with a business account. From there they can create a new company profile, by providing information such as name, description, legal documents, proof of existence, number
                of shares they want to start with etc. The company will then be created on the blockchain and will be displayed on the dashboard.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The owner of the company can then create more shares if they want, which means the proportion of shares/company ownership will change. Furthermore, an owner can buy shares from their own company which will be registered as ‘Director Shares’.
                We allow a business user to create multiple companies on Ammoenio if they wish to.
            </p>
